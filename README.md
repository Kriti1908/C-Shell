## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- **GCC**: To compile the shell.
- **Make**: For build automation (optional but recommended).

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open your terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/C-Shell.git
   cd C-Shell
   ```

2. **Build the Shell** \
   Compile the source code using the provided Makefile:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    If you don't have make, you can compile manually:
    ```bash
    gcc ./*.c
    ```

3. **Run the Shell**
   ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```

## Usage

### Launch the shell:
- 
    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```
    Start entering commands just like in a standard terminal. \
    You can use built-in commands or system commands.

### Use advanced features like:

- 
    ### Command chaining:
    ```bash
    <command1> ; <command2>
    ```

- 
    ### Background execution:
    ```bash
    <command> &
    ```

- 
    ### Redirection and piping:
    ```bash
    <command> > <file>
    <command1> | <command2>
    ```

- 
    ### Explore custom commands:

    - #### Navigate with hop:
        ```bash
        hop /path/to/directory
        ```

        ```bash
        log execute <commandIndex> 
        ```

    - #### View status of a process with proclore
      ``` bash
      proclore <pid>
      ```

    - #### Find a file or directory using seek
      ```bash
      seek <fileName/directoryName>
      ```
      - Add flag -f to only find files
      - Add flag -d to only find directories
      - Add flag -e to execute the unique file, if found, or jump to the unique directory, if found.
  
    - #### See the status of processes using activities.
      ```bash
      activities
      ```

    - #### Add your own custom functionalities by editing .myshrc.
    - #### Manage processes with fg, bg, or proclore.
    - #### Exit the shell anytime with exit or Ctrl+D.
    - #### Interrupt running programs with Ctrl+C
